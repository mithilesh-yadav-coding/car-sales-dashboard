I’m excited to showcase my latest Power BI project, where I transformed raw automotive data into an interactive and actionable Car Sales Dashboard. This project focuses on key performance indicators like total sales, revenue, and customer insights across different car brands and models. It’s built with a clear goal in mind: making complex data accessible, intuitive, and visually impactful for better decision-making! 💡

𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔:

🔍 Data Insights: In-depth analysis of car sales trends, popular car brands, and regional performance.

🎨 Visual Design: Bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs to represent key metrics with clarity.

🛠️ Tools Used: Power BI for dashboards, Power Query for data transformation, and DAX for calculations.

📈 Forecasting: Leveraging historical data to predict future sales trends.

This project emphasizes how data analysis can drive better decision-making, improve sales strategies, and provide a clearer picture of performance across various segments of the automotive industry. Power BI’s ability to create tailored dashboards makes it an indispensable tool for any data analyst.
